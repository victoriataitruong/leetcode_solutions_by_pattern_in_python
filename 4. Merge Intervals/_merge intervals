The merge intervals pattern is a common problem-solving technique used in problems involving ranges or intervals. The goal is typically to combine overlapping intervals into a single interval and return the list of merged intervals.

Problem Explanation:
Given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a pair of numbers [start, end], your task is to merge overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals.

Example:
Input: [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7], [6, 8]]

After merging overlapping intervals, the output should be: [[1, 4], [5, 8]]

Key Steps for the Merge Intervals Pattern:
Sort the intervals by their start times: Sorting helps to easily check if the current interval overlaps with the next one.

Iterate through the intervals:

For each interval, compare it with the last added merged interval.

If they overlap (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the last merged interval), merge them.

Otherwise, just add the current interval to the result list.

Detailed Explanation:
Sorting: Start by sorting the intervals based on the start value of each interval. Sorting is important because, after sorting, the intervals are processed in a sequential manner, and checking for overlaps becomes easier.

Merging:

Begin with the first interval as the current "merged" interval.

For each subsequent interval, check if it overlaps with the last merged interval:

If the interval does not overlap (its start time is greater than the end of the last merged interval), then add it as a new merged interval.

If the interval does overlap (its start time is less than or equal to the end of the last merged interval), merge it by updating the end time of the last merged interval to the maximum of the two end times.

def mergeIntervals(intervals):
    # If intervals list is empty or has only one element, return it as is
    if not intervals or len(intervals) == 1:
        return intervals
    
    # Step 1: Sort intervals by their start times
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Step 2: Initialize the result list with the first interval
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the rest of the intervals
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        # Get the last merged interval
        last_merged = merged[-1]
        
        # Step 4: Check if the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval
        if current[0] <= last_merged[1]:  # Overlapping intervals
            # Merge the intervals by updating the end time to the maximum of both ends
            last_merged[1] = max(last_merged[1], current[1])
        else:
            # If no overlap, add the current interval to the result
            merged.append(current)
    
    return merged
Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input intervals: [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7], [6, 8]]

Step 1: Sort the intervals by their start times:

Sorted intervals: [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7], [6, 8]]

Step 2: Start with the first interval [1, 3] and initialize the merged list: [[1, 3]].

Step 3: Iterate through the rest of the intervals:

Compare [2, 4] with the last merged interval [1, 3]. Since they overlap (the start of [2, 4] is less than or equal to the end of [1, 3]), merge them by updating the end time of [1, 3] to 4. So the merged list becomes: [[1, 4]].

Compare [5, 7] with [1, 4]. They do not overlap (the start of [5, 7] is greater than the end of [1, 4]), so add [5, 7] to the merged list. The merged list becomes: [[1, 4], [5, 7]].

Compare [6, 8] with [5, 7]. Since they overlap, merge them by updating the end time to 8. The final merged list becomes: [[1, 4], [5, 8]].

Step 4: Return the merged intervals: [[1, 4], [5, 8]].

Time Complexity:
Sorting the intervals: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.

Iterating through the intervals: O(n), where n is the number of intervals.

Total time complexity: O(n log n), dominated by the sorting step.

Space Complexity:
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the merged intervals in the result list.

Edge Cases to Consider:
No intervals: If the input is an empty list, return an empty list.

Single interval: If there’s only one interval, it doesn’t need merging.

Non-overlapping intervals: If no intervals overlap, each interval will be returned as is.

Completely overlapping intervals: If all intervals are the same or fully overlap, they should merge into a single interval.

Intervals with the same start or end times: These should still be merged if they overlap.

Example with Edge Cases:
Input: [[1, 3], [3, 5], [6, 7], [2, 4]]

After sorting: [[1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [6, 7]]

Merged intervals: [[1, 5], [6, 7]]

Conclusion:
The merge intervals pattern is a great example of using sorting combined with a greedy approach to solve range-based problems. By sorting intervals by their start times, you can easily merge overlapping intervals in linear time after sorting, making the approach efficient and easy to implement.
