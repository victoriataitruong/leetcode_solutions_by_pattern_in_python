The Union-Find pattern (also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU)) is a data structure that efficiently handles operations on a collection of disjoint sets. It is mainly used to manage and manipulate a group of elements partitioned into disjoint sets. The two primary operations in Union-Find are:

Union: This operation merges two sets into a single set.

Find: This operation determines which set an element belongs to.

Key Operations:
Find: This operation is used to determine the representative (or root) of the set that an element belongs to. It helps identify if two elements are in the same set or not.

Union: This operation merges two sets into one. It typically does this by connecting the roots of the sets of the two elements. To keep the structure efficient, union by rank or union by size is often used to ensure the tree representing the sets remains balanced.

Path Compression: This optimization is used during the Find operation to make future queries faster. After performing a Find, you make every node along the path point directly to the root. This flattens the tree structure, leading to almost constant time complexity for subsequent operations.

Union by Rank/Size: When performing a union, instead of attaching the smaller tree to the larger tree, you attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. This keeps the tree balanced, reducing the height and making operations more efficient.

Applications:
Union-Find is commonly used in problems involving connected components, such as:

Network connectivity: Checking if two elements are connected.

MST (Minimum Spanning Tree): Kruskal's algorithm for finding the MST uses Union-Find to manage connected components.

Cycle detection: Detecting cycles in an undirected graph.

        # Initialize the parent list and rank (or size) list
        self.parent = list(range(size))  # Each element is its own parent initially
        self.rank = [0] * size  # Rank (or size) of each set

    # Find with path compression
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            # Path compression: make every node in the path point to the root
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    # Union by rank (or size)
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)

        if rootX != rootY:  # Only union if they are in different sets
            # Union by rank: attach the smaller tree to the larger tree
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1  # Increase rank if both roots are same

    # Helper function to check if two elements are connected
    def connected(self, x, y):
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)

# Example Usage:
uf = UnionFind(5)  # 5 elements, 0 through 4

# Union operations
uf.union(0, 1)
uf.union(1, 2)
uf.union(3, 4)

# Find operations
print(uf.find(0))  # Output: 0 (root of the set containing 0)
print(uf.find(1))  # Output: 0 (root of the set containing 1)
print(uf.find(2))  # Output: 0 (root of the set containing 2)
print(uf.find(3))  # Output: 3 (root of the set containing 3)

# Check if two elements are connected
print(uf.connected(0, 2))  # Output: True (they are in the same set)
print(uf.connected(0, 3))  # Output: False (they are in different sets)
Explanation:
Initialization: We initialize the parent list where each element is its own parent, and the rank list to keep track of the depth (or size) of the tree for union operations.

Find Operation with Path Compression:

We recursively find the root of the set an element belongs to.

While finding the root, we apply path compression, which makes every node on the path point directly to the root, speeding up future find operations.

Union by Rank:

When two sets are merged, we use union by rank. The rank helps us attach the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree, ensuring the tree remains shallow.

If both trees have the same rank, we arbitrarily choose one root as the new root and increase its rank by 1.

Connected Operation:

We can check if two elements are connected by checking if their roots are the same.

Time Complexity:
Find operation: O(α(n)) where α is the inverse Ackermann function (very slow-growing), so this is nearly constant time for practical inputs.

Union operation: O(α(n)) because we perform a find operation for both elements and then union them.

Both operations are extremely efficient due to path compression and union by rank.

Space Complexity:
O(n) where n is the number of elements, because we store the parent and rank arrays.

Applications of Union-Find:
Network Connectivity: Checking if two nodes are connected in a dynamic graph (i.e., after adding edges).

Kruskal’s Algorithm for MST: Union-Find is used to keep track of connected components while building the Minimum Spanning Tree.

Cycle Detection: Detecting cycles in an undirected graph by using Union-Find to check if two nodes are already in the same set when attempting to add an edge.

Dynamic Connectivity Problems: Handling dynamic updates to a graph, where edges are added, and we need to keep track of connected components.

Example Problem - Cycle Detection in an Undirected Graph:
To check if an undirected graph contains a cycle, we can use Union-Find:

For each edge, check if the two nodes are in the same set (using find).

If they are, a cycle is detected (because there is already a path between these nodes).

Otherwise, perform a union operation to merge the sets of the two nodes.

def hasCycle(edges, n):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    for u, v in edges:
        if uf.connected(u, v):
            return True  # Cycle found
        uf.union(u, v)
    return False  # No cycle

edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)]  # This will form a cycle
n = 4  # Number of nodes
print(hasCycle(edges, n))  # Output: True
In this case, Union-Find efficiently detects whether the graph has a cycle while processing edges.
