Leetcode 261: Graph Valid Tree

Problem Description:
Given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1` and a list of edges, determine if the graph is a valid tree. A valid tree is a connected acyclic graph. Specifically:
- The graph must have exactly `n-1` edges (because a tree with `n` nodes always has `n-1` edges).
- The graph must be connected (there must be a path between every pair of nodes).

Approach:
1. **Edge Count Check**: A tree with `n` nodes must have exactly `n-1` edges.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to traverse the graph and check if it is connected (every node is visited) and does not contain any cycles.
3. **Cycle Detection**: If during the DFS traversal, we encounter a previously visited node (thatâ€™s not the immediate parent), we have detected a cycle.
