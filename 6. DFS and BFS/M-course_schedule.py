Leetcode 207: Course Schedule

Problem Description:
You are given a number of courses, each with prerequisites, and you need to determine if it's possible to finish all the courses. Each course may have prerequisites, represented as a directed graph where an edge from course `a` to course `b` means that course `a` is a prerequisite for course `b`. The problem asks if it's possible to complete all courses without encountering a cycle. If a cycle exists in the graph, it would be impossible to finish the courses. The solution must return `True` if it's possible to finish all courses, and `False` otherwise.

Approach:
1. **Topological Sorting Using Kahnâ€™s Algorithm**: This approach uses a graph and in-degree of each node (course). We perform a BFS starting from courses with no prerequisites and reduce the in-degree of other courses as we complete each course.
2. **Check for Cycles**: If, after processing all courses, there are still courses with non-zero in-degree, it means there is a cycle, and completing all courses is impossible.
3. **Return True or False**: If all courses are processed successfully, return `True`. If a cycle is detected, return `False`.
