LeetCode Problem 269: Alien Dictionary

Problem Description:
You are given a list of words from an alien dictionary, where the order of characters is different from the order in the English alphabet. You need to determine the lexicographical order of the characters in the alien language.

Example 1:
text
Copy
Edit
Input: words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
Example 2:
text
Copy
Edit
Input: words = ["z", "x"]
Output: "zx"
Example 3:
text
Copy
Edit
Input: words = ["abc", "ab"]
Output: ""
Explanation: The given order is invalid, because the prefix "ab" is longer than the word "abc", which is impossible in a lexicographical order.
Solution Approach:
This problem can be solved using Topological Sorting because it asks us to find an ordering of characters (nodes) in a directed graph where edges represent the constraints imposed by the words.

Steps:
Create a Graph: We will treat each character as a node and the order between characters as directed edges. For example, if wrt comes before wrf, it implies that t comes before f.

Topological Sorting: We will perform a topological sort on the directed graph. If a cycle is detected, it means the ordering is impossible, and we return an empty string.

Kahn's Algorithm (for Topological Sort): We can use Kahn's algorithm, which is an efficient way to do topological sorting using a BFS approach and a queue.

Algorithm:
Build the graph using the constraints from the words.

Use Kahnâ€™s algorithm to perform topological sorting.

Return the result as a string if the topological sort is successful; otherwise, return an empty string.
